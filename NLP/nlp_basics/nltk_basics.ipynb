And he said, Bring them, I pray\nthee, unto me, and I will bless them.\nNow the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\nsee. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,\nand embraced them.\nAnd Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy\nfa and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\nAnd Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he\nbowed himself with his face to the earth.\nAnd Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\nIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward\nIsrael's right hand, and brought them near unto him.\nAnd Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\nEphraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon\nManasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was\nthe firstborn.\nAnd he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life\nlong unto this day,\nThe Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and\nlet my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the\nmidst of the earth.\nAnd when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon\nthe head of Ephraim, it displeased h and he held up his\nfather's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto\nManasseh's head.\nAnd Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this\nis the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\nAnd his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know\nhe also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:\nbut truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and\nhis seed shall become a multitude of nations.\nAnd he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel\nbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manass and\nhe set Ephraim before Manasseh.\nAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be\nwith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\nMoreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and\nwith my bow.\nAnd Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves\ntogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in\nthe last days.\nGather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and\nhearken unto Israel your father.\nReuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of\nmy strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of\npow\nUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel;

every one\naccording to his blessing he blessed them.\nAnd he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered\nunto my peop bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in\nthe field of Ephron the Hittite,\nIn the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before\nMamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the\nfield of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a\nburyingplace.\nThere they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they\nburied Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\nThe purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was\nfrom the children of Heth.\nAnd when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he\ngathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,\nand was gathered unto his people.\nAnd Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and\nkissed him.\nAnd Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his\nfath and the physicians embalmed Israel.\nAnd forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled\nthe days of those which are embalm and the Egyptians\nmourned for him threescore and ten days.\nAnd when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto\nthe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in\nyour eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\nMy father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which\nI have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou\nbury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my\nfather, and I will come again.\nAnd Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he\nmade thee swear.\nAnd Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up\nall the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all\nthe elders of the land of Egypt,\nAnd all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his\nfather's hou only their little ones, and their flocks, and\ntheir herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\nAnd there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it\nwas a very great company.\nAnd they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond\nJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore\nlamentati and he made a mourning for his father seven days.\nAnd when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the\nmourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous\nmourning to the Egyptia wherefore the name of it was called\nAbelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.\nAnd his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:\nFor his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried\nhim in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham\nbought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of\nEphron the Hittite, before Mamre.\nAnd Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all\nthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried\nhis father.\nAnd when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,\nthey said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will\ncertainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.\nAnd they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did\ncommand before he died, saying,\nSo shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the\ntrespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto\nthee ev and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the\nservants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they\nspake unto him.\nAnd his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and\nthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.\nAnd Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of\nGod?\nBut as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it\nunto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much\npeople alive.\nNow therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little\nones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\nAnd Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and\nJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.\nAnd Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the\nchildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up\nupon Joseph's knees.\nAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely\nvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which\nhe sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\nAnd Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God\nwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from\nhence.\nSo Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they\nembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\n"
