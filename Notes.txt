NumPy - NumPy is a Python library, which supports efficient handling of various numerical operations on arrays
        holding numeric data.
    -> Arrays known as n-dimentional array or ndarray
    -> each data element in ndarray is of fixed size
    -> ndarray attribute
        -> ndim : Returns number of dimensions.
        -> shape: Returns Shape in tuple.
        -> size : Total number of elements.
        -> dtype : Type of each element.
        -> itemsize : Size of each element in Bytes.
        -> nbytes : Total bytes consumed by all elements.
    -> Datatype can be defined with the argument "dtype"
    -> creating values with same value
        x = numpy.full(shape=(2,3),fill_values=2)
        create all values with 2 with shape 2 rows and 3 cols
    -> reshaping the array
        x.reshape(2,2,2)\
    -> Operations in Numpy are carried out element wise.
       Hence the expression x + 10, increases every element of array x by 10.
