NumPy - NumPy is a Python library, which supports efficient handling of various numerical operations on arrays
        holding numeric data.
    -> Arrays known as n-dimentional array or ndarray
    -> each data element in ndarray is of fixed size
    -> ndarray attribute
        -> ndim : Returns number of dimensions.
        -> shape: Returns Shape in tuple.
        -> size : Total number of elements.
        -> dtype : Type of each element.
        -> itemsize : Size of each element in Bytes.
        -> nbytes : Total bytes consumed by all elements.
    -> Datatype can be defined with the argument "dtype"
    -> creating values with same value
        x = numpy.full(shape=(2,3),fill_values=2)
        create all values with 2 with shape 2 rows and 3 cols
    -> reshaping the array
        x.reshape(2,2,2)\
    -> Operations in Numpy are carried out element wise.
       Hence the expression x + 10, increases every element of array x by 10.

Pandas - Its a data analysis tool, provides easy to use highly efficient data structures, deal with numeric,
         labelled data stored in form of tables
         Pandas is build on numpy
       -> Fundamental data structures in pandas
            - Series: A 1-D array.
            - Data Frame: A 2-D array or two or more Series joined together
            - Panel: A 3-D array
       -> Describe() method provides details like mean, std etc about a series
       -> info() method provides the data about the data-frame
       -> read_csv is used to read data from a CSV file and to_csv is utilized to write data to a CSV file.
       -> Indexing the dataframe , df.index = [] some list
            - pandas support date time indexing
       -> Data Cleaning
            Pandas provide methods like drop_duplicates, isnull, etc to deal with missing data.
MatPlotLib - Used for data visualisation
        -> Figure: Whole area chosen for plotting.
        -> Axes: Area where data is plotted.
        -> Axis: Number-line like objects, which define graph limits.
        -> Artist: Every element on the figure is an artist.
